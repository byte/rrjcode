This is all little pieces of code, snippets, and more /crap/ that doesn't fit anywhere, really. I might have tried to learn something, and these were the scraps that came with it. Use at your own risk. This used to be maintained at http://bytebot.net/rrjcode/ and the idea of creating a junk code "directory" came from Tridge, at linux.conf.au 2005 (afaik).
